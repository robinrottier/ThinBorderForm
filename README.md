Windows Form base class, with a thin border that is resizeable and movable and also positions the main menu on the "caption" next to form title.

Simply create your new form and change default base class from Form to derive from rrSoft.ThinBorderForm instead.

Docked child controls sit within "new" client area, other controls can be positioned over the "caption" if required.
